        <p> Hi! my name is Suman Paik. I’m a Web developer, and I specialize in efficient React apps and CSS and HTML that just work across all platforms and browsers. I care deeply about building interfaces that are actually usable. My professional life has been 100 percent driven by my passion for web development. Right now I’m 22 years old and I’m very excited to start my career as a Web developer. One last thing is I am interested in Blockchain technology as my future vision.
            In the year 2022, I have finished my Bachelor of Computer Application degree from Midnapore College (Autonomous)(Location: India, State: West Bengal). As an experience, I would like to say that I am learning Web Development and I have made some front-end designs and other stuff related to this. My GitHub profile is my personal container for me where I push everything about my journey, projects, and other kinds of stuff. And now I am continuously learning new technologies.</p>
